## Getting started

There is a context/ directory with three files:

- bootstrap.md: this file
- context.md: context/general overview
- todo.md: your to-do list of pending work items
- done.md: a list of things you've done
- scratchpad.md: a file for storing useful things to remember across sessions,
  e.g. things learnt about the environment

Ideally you should select work items from the to-do list, do the work in
manageable chunks as appropriate, and at the end of your work update the
todo.md and done.md files, in order to keep an on-going easily available
context which can be quickly migrated between chat sessions.
